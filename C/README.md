# A demo Mongoose OS firmware for C/C++

## Overview

This is an demo app, serves as a skeleton for building Mongoose OS
apps from scratch in C/C++. It implements the same functionality
as [demo-js](https://github.com/mongoose-os-apps/demo-js) does, but
uses C/C++ instead of JavaScript.

See [Mongoose OS C/C++ quickstart](https://mongoose-os.com/docs/quickstart/using-c-cpp.html) for
the C/C++ development introduction.
